# Yelp Rating Prediction
Developed, tested, and trained a fully connected neural network (FCNN) to predict Yelp restaurant ratings based on text from user reviews.

Used TF-IDF to process review text and experimented with different model structures and hyperparameters to create a more accurate model.

The `main` branch contains the most accurate model developed after project presentation (improved based on student learnings and professor recommendations), while the `submit` branch contains the initial submission.

Part of an assignment for a Deep Learning course.
